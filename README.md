## What it is

Ports and Adapters architecture(or more known as hexagonal architecture) is implemented. Tried to follow philosophy of 'Real Life Clean Architecture(RLCA)' of matter-battiston in Go lang, and make our 'Uncle Bob' proud again.

It is not classical layered architecture. Compared to RLCA, I put more focus on actors, and explicitly 



## Why I made this

There are two quotes that I like from Clean Architecutre.

> The center of your application is not the database. Nor is it one or more of the frameworks you may be using. **The center of your application is the use cases of your application** - *Unclebob* ([source](https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/05/15/NODB.html))

> The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that each software module should have one and only one reason to change - *Unclebob* ([source](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/08/SingleReponsibilityPrinciple.html))

When I was studying implementations of clean architectures written with golang, I thought actor and usecase need more emphasis , and need to 'scream more'. And stacking up entity to service, using same name again and again from entity to service or controller, is better to be avoided, and I thought we should more focus on SRP. Maybe I'm a bit presumptuous for noob gopher, but that was my take.



## Port and Adapter approach

![hexa_structure](./hexa_structure.png)

Above depictes the hexagonal architecture and comparison on classical layered clean architecture.

* Incoming port, Outgoing port
  * They are 'sockets' that incoming adapter and outgoing adapter relies on.
  * Not the other way around.
* Alias
  * incoming port --> Usecase
  * outgoing port --> Port
  * incoming adapter --> Entrypoint
  * outgoing adapter --> DataProvider
* Intended to follow hexagonal architecture(port and adapter architecture)'s terminology and avoid terminology of classical layered clean architecture.
* Usecase interactor is incoming ports. Ports are outgoing ports.



## Folder structure

* /internal
  * core --> core layer of clean architecture
    * entity --> domain models
    * usecase --> (ports) service interactors and port declarations
  * infra --> outter layer of clean architecture
    * configuration --> configures objects
    * dataprovider --> (outgoing adapter) connects to DB. implements Ports
    * entrypoint --> (incoming adapter) controllers(web, rest, ws ...), routers



## To run

``` bash
go run .
```



## Future plan

* Integration test needed for all usecase ports
* Web front needed
* Maybe I will be able to implement CQRS - all data access command is managed by ports, and direct interface is hidden from usecase user, so it is viable dream(or I dream too much!)
